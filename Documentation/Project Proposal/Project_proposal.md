## 3. Motivation / Problem Statement

Investing in the stock market has become an increasingly essential skill in today’s financial world. However, beginners often face significant barriers when trying to enter the market:

1. **Limited Awareness Among Indian Learners** – Most Indian students and retail traders are only familiar with the Indian stock market (NSE/BSE). They lack exposure to the **US market**, which is the world’s largest and most influential. This gap limits their global financial literacy and prevents them from exploring diverse investment opportunities.
2. **High Risk of Financial Loss** – Many individuals hesitate to trade because of the fear of losing real money due to inexperience and lack of knowledge.
3. **Lack of Practical Exposure** – While there are countless resources for learning stock market concepts, very few platforms allow learners to apply their knowledge in a risk-free, hands-on environment.
4. **Overwhelming Information** – The US stock market is vast, with thousands of stocks, financial news sources, and metrics, which can be intimidating for beginners.
5. **Low Engagement in Learning** – Traditional educational resources like textbooks or tutorials fail to capture user engagement, leading to low retention of trading strategies and market knowledge.

👉 To bridge this gap, **TradeUp** is envisioned as an interactive, gamified, and risk-free platform where users, especially Indian students and aspiring traders, can practice trading in the **US stock market** with virtual money.

By integrating real-time stock data, financial news, quizzes, and performance tracking, the platform reduces entry barriers, provides exposure to international markets, and makes learning both practical and engaging.

This approach not only helps beginners build confidence and decision-making skills before investing real money but also equips Indian learners with the knowledge and experience needed to understand and navigate the US market, broadening their perspective and preparing them for global investment opportunities.

## 4. Target Users and Use Cases

**Target Users:**

* Students: University and high school students studying finance, business, or economics who want to gain practical exposure to trading.
* Beginner Investors: Individuals new to the stock market who wish to understand trading strategies before investing real money.
* Indian Learners & Retail Traders: Students and traders in India who are primarily familiar with NSE/BSE and want to gain exposure to the US market in a risk-free environment.
* Hobbyists: Anyone with a casual interest in the stock market looking for an engaging and gamified way to learn and compete with peers.

**Use Cases:**

* **User Onboarding:** A new user signs up, receives an initial virtual cash balance, and can immediately start exploring stocks.
* **Executing a Trade:** A user researches a stock like Apple (AAPL), decides to buy 10 shares at the current market price, and executes the trade. The transaction is then recorded in their history.
* **Portfolio Management:** A user reviews their portfolio to see which stocks are performing well and which are not, deciding whether to hold or sell certain assets.
* **Educational Quiz:** A user participates in a daily quiz about trading terminology. For each correct answer, they earn points that boost their position on a leaderboard.
* **Market Analysis:** A user checks the "Top Gainers" and "Top Losers" sections to identify market trends and potential trading opportunities.
* **Peer Competition:** A group of friends or classmates use TradeUp to compete with each other in trading challenges, fostering engagement and collaborative learning.
* **Practical Exposure to US Market:** An Indian student uses the platform to understand the functioning of US-listed companies (like Tesla, Amazon, or Microsoft) and gains familiarity with global financial markets without financial risk.
