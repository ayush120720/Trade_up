# 🧪 Test Plan: Trade Up - Paper Trading and Gamification Platform

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this **Final Test Plan** is to define the scope, approach, resources, and schedule of the testing activities for the **Trade Up** application.  
This document serves as a comprehensive guide, mapping testing activities to the key user processes and steps within the application.

### 1.2 Scope
The testing scope covers all core functionalities of the Trade Up application, structured around the following key user processes:

- **User Authentication Process:** Sign Up, Log In, Log Out, Profile Update  
- **Paper Trading Process:** Stock Search, Buy Transaction, Sell Transaction, Portfolio View, Transaction History  
- **Gamification Process:** Quiz Attempt, Virtual Currency Earning, Leaderboard Ranking  

### 1.3 Objectives
The primary objectives of this testing effort are to:

- ✅ Verify that all documented User Stories and Acceptance Criteria are correctly implemented.  
- ✅ Ensure the application is stable, reliable, and performs efficiently under expected load.  
- ✅ Confirm the security of user data and transaction processes.  
- ✅ Identify and document any defects or deviations from the expected behavior.

## 2. Test Strategy: Process-Oriented Approach

### 2.1 Test Levels and Types

| **Test Level** | **Description** | **Focus** |
|----------------|-----------------|------------|
| **Unit Testing** | Testing individual components (functions, classes) of the client and server code. | Code correctness, internal logic. |
| **Integration Testing** | Testing interfaces/interactions between modules (client-server, DB, APIs). | Data flow, API contract adherence. |
| **System Testing** | End-to-end testing of the fully integrated application. | Functional & non-functional requirements. |
| **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)** | Final testing by end-users/stakeholders. | Usability, business process validation. |

#### Test Types
- **Functional Testing:** Verify features (Authentication, Trading, Quizzes, Leaderboard).  
- **Security Testing:** Validate secure handling of credentials and data protection.  
- **Performance Testing:** Measure responsiveness and stability under load.  
- **Usability Testing:** Assess user interface intuitiveness and navigation.

### 2.2 Detailed Testing Processes and Steps

#### **Process 1: User Authentication and Profile Management**

| **Process Step** | **Description** | **Key Test Focus** |
|------------------|-----------------|--------------------|
| **P1.1: Registration** | User provides email and password to create an account. | Data validation, unique email, account creation success. |
| **P1.2: Login** | User provides credentials to access account. | Credential validation, JWT token, dashboard redirection. |
| **P1.3: Logout** | User terminates the session. | Token invalidation, secure logout, redirect to login. |
| **P1.4: Profile Update** | User updates personal info or password. | Data persistence, password security, immediate updates. |
